# TicTacToe AI Agent
## Project description
This project was made as a part of the 'Intro to Artificial Intelligence' class in Computer Science Undergraduate program at the Faculty of Science, University of Split.

It is a simple terminal game to showcase AI Agent's ability to play the game.
Algorithms showcased:
* Minimax 
* Alpha-beta Pruning

**NOTE**

After revisiting the project I found the bug with the AI and Python notebook implementation.

Project will be reworked as a Django based web game.
